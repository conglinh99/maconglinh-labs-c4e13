- we should use functions at all to organizw programs into chunk that match how we think about the problem.
- to define a function, we use the following syntax:
		def NAME(PARAMETERS):
			STATEMENTS
- to call/use a function, we use:
	import file_containing_that_function
or:
	from file_containing_that_fuction import that_function
- the return statement is followed an expression. This expression will be evaluated and returned to the caller as the "last call" of calling this function.
- we don't have to return in every function
- Most functions require arguments: the arguments provide for generalization
- To use function from a different file other than our currently working file we can use the syntax:
from name_file import function
or
name_file.function
